# SimpleFiber
A very simple Fiber Optics Cable simulation with Ansys HFSS and some basic explanation regarding simulation results
You can find the results of the simulation, followed by some basic explanation of why they have to be case, in `results.ipynb` jupyter notebook. if you don't have jupyter installed, simply check out the official tutorial on how to install it on your machine in [this link](https://jupyter.org/install)

# Simulation Files
You can download the files for the simulation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PBZ1jnUwC-BQiRHtQnR-rQwHdOFlpLSn/view?usp=drive_link)

# Contribution
If there's any problem with the simulation files or there's an error in the explanation or you have ideas on how to better explain them or adding your own (perhaps new) explanations, please feel free to create an issue and then submit a PR!
