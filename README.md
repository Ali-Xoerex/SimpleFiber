# Simulations
This repo contains all of my simulation files and results and explanations. Simulation files have been uploaded directly on Github if the size were reasonable and if not, a download link have been provided.
It is encouraged to perform the simulations on your local machine if you can, since it enriches the experience and helps you learn more about them.
The simulations do not have a fixed theme and they can be about various systems, be it mechanical, electrical, etc. 

# Contribution
The simulations have been designed with the goal of learning more about the systems being simulated, in mind. So if you think the explanations are not sufficient or are wrong, feel free to submit an issue and maybe a PR!
