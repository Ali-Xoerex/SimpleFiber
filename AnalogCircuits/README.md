# Analog Circuits
Very basic and useful analog circuits simulation using Proteus, including :
* Inverting & Non-Inverting Gain blocks
* Analog adder circuit
* Buffer,NOT,AND,OR Gates using BJT transistors

The simulation is interactive in case of logic gates, which helps demonstrating the effects they have on output.
